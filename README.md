    ░▒▓ brutas ▓▒░ Wordlists, handcrafted with ♥

## Descriptions

* `brutas-top-3000.txt` - kept under 3000 lines so it runs fast enough - collection of most common passwords, typical close-keys combinations, bands, brands, games and movies characters, based on real life penetration tests and leaks analysis
* `brutas-top-15000.txt` - top 3000 combined with tops from other password lists, in case the smaller one fails
* `brutas-permutations.txt` - hax0r/1337 style with hashcat rules applied to common usernames and basic passwords
* `brutas-usernames-unix.txt` - not much to explain I guess
