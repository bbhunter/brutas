## Descriptions

**NOTE** These dictionaries are not sorted by probability. They are grouped instead.

### Passwords

The order is also suggested workflow (approx. size):

1. `brutas-passwords-3k.txt` - kept small so it runs fast enough - collection of most common passwords, typical close-keys combinations, bands, brands, games and movies characters etc. (3k)
2. `brutas-passwords-10k.txt` - second shot after the 3k dictionary, contains data from leaks and some tops from other password lists (10k)
3. `brutas-passwords-adminz.txt` - suitable for internal usage, `brutas-usernames.txt` with hax0r and years rules on top (10k)
4. `brutas-passwords-3k-hax0r.txt` - hax0r/1337 style applied to the 3k list (170k)
5. `brutas-passwords-3k-years.txt` - try appending 2000-2024 before anything else, keep things simple (80k)
6. `brutas-passwords-10k-hax0r.txt` - applied to 10k (600k)
7. `brutas-passwords-10k-years.txt` - applied to 10k (300k)

### Usernames

* `brutas-usernames.txt` - most common usernames, keeping low in number

### Subdomains

* `brutas-subdomains-3k.txt` - a fairly reasonable list for host discovery composed of common conventions, self-hosted software etc.
* `brutas-subdomains-250k.txt` - extended list with some extra pre-/postfixes like `host-srv`, `f.host` or `host10`
* `brutas-subdomains-keywords.*` - keywords and rules used to generate lists for subdomains
