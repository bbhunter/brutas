> Wordlists and passwords handcrafted with â™¥

A pretty comprehensive set of password dictionaries and wordlists designed for quick wins in red teaming scenarios. Why is it different? The goal here is not to crack every password possible, it is to move forward inside a network. And if cracking is really needed then the bigger lists can be used, however, the assumption here is that it will be done in a reasonable time span and with limited resources (like a VM, hijacked host etc).

A few facts:
* The rulesets, keywords and password combinations are based on analysis of roughly 400GB of pure data and dozens of peer-reviewed scientific articles.
* It is not an ordinary dump of all things available. All wordlists and rules were processed manually.
* The HTTP paths and files dictionaries are designed to avoid alerting WAFs, there are no payloads that can be easily detected as it is the case with many popular lists.

## Introduction

A brief introduction to `brutas-passwords-#` lists:
* the number of passwords grows with the consecutive file number;
* passwords are not sorted according to the probability, they are combined into groups of probability instead;
* each consecutive file **does not** contain passwords from any of the previous sets.

**NOTE: Due to Github limits, only lists 1-3 are precompiled.** You need to run `./scripts/build.py -p main.Extended` to generate the complete set (see the tutorial below).

## Tutorial

### Rebuilding the basic lists

`% ./scripts/build.py`

### Building the extended lists using external drive for temporary files and output

`% ./scripts/build.py -p main.Extended -t /media/user/External/tmp -o /media/user/External`

### Generating password list using custom keywords

`% ./scripts/build.py -p main.Custom -t /media/user/External/tmp/custom -o /media/user/External/custom`

### Using specific language

There are two options:
1) either overwrite `brutas-lang-int-*.txt` files;
2) or use the `main.Custom` class with keywords copied to `keywords/brutas-custom.txt`.

The first one would cause the build to use the specific language as the base, while other languages would still be used (starting with `brutas-passwords-6-xl.txt` list). The second option would ignore the normal build process and use the full set of rules on the `keywords/brutas-custom.txt` file. You should expect a massive output in that case.

### Configuration

You can store your local configuration in `scripts/local_config.py`. For example, you may want to disable some rules (or add your own?), or change paths to `hashcat-utils` binaries.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* hashcat-utils
* lzop (recommended)
* Bash

### Some stats and hints

* The `main.Extended` generator takes roughly six hours to complete on a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and currently requires 130GB of free disk space to store the final results plus roughly 300GB for temporary files, SSD highly recommended.
* File sizes for `main.Extended`:
    * brutas-passwords-5-l.txt (~400MB)
    * brutas-passwords-6-xl.txt (~2.5GB)
    * brutas-passwords-7-xxl.txt (~130GB)
* Building password list with `main.Custom` and `keywords/brutas-custom.txt` containing 5.5k of lines generates approx. 560GB of data and requires around 680GB for temporary files (an extra drive is recommended due to heavy I/O).

## Detailed description

The combined lists `brutas-passwords-{1,2,3,4}-*.txt` seem to be most effective for general purpose and reasonably fast password cracking. Start with the smallest one and move forward. The lists `brutas-passwords-{1,2}-*.txt` are designed for a quick win in large networks. If you need something really minimalistic, try using `brutas-passwords-1-xxs.txt` solely - my highly opinionated view of the top 100. 

However, I recommend experimenting on your own and rebuilding these sets depending on the target. You may want to incorporate your native language keywords, too. For example, file or a domain name combined with `brutas-passwords-numbers.txt` turns out to be pretty effective on encrypted archives and wireless networks. As with everything, a little social engineering comes handy to understand the local approach to the "password policy".

* `brutas-passwords-{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}-*.txt` - wordlists combined with passwords generated using keywords, hashcat rules and string partials (see `brutas/scripts/main/__init__.py` for details)
* `brutas-passwords-classics.txt` - typical admin passwords based on roles (test, admin), words (password, secret) or "funny" ones (like `letmein` or `trustno1`)
* `brutas-passwords-patterns.txt` - close key combinations or simple phrases (e.g. `abcd`) combined with capitalization, numbers, repetitions etc.
* `brutas-passwords-top.txt` - is a list composed of most popular user passwords found in leaks, doesn't contain close keys or any more sophisticated combinations
* `brutas-passwords-unique.txt` - passwords which are complex enough to be used as independent passwords and are rarely mixed with any extra characters, usually related to pop-culture or sports (e.g. `apollo13`, `9inchnails`, `ronaldo7`)
* `brutas-passwords-numbers.txt` - a small list of numbers used in passwords (e.g. dates, math constants)

### Other lists

* `brutas-http-files-extensions-common.txt` - common file extensions
* `brutas-http-files-extensions-less.txt` - less common extensions
* `brutas-http-files-generic.txt` - generic file names for automated discovery
* `brutas-http-files-unique.txt` - unique file names e.g. `.bash_history`, `WEB-INF/web.xml`
* `brutas-http-params.txt` - simplistic and realistic approach to HTTP parameters
* `brutas-http-paths.txt` - no path traversal or pseudo exploits to keep low profile, no subs (use recursion instead) - paths only
* `brutas-usernames.txt` - most common usernames
* `brutas-usernames-small.txt` - a short list of usernames
* `brutas-ports-tcp-http.txt` - common and not that obvious HTTP ports
* `brutas-ports-tcp-internal.txt` - list of TCP services that may come up internally
* `brutas-ports-tcp-public.txt` - list of public TCP ports, useful for host discovery

### Subdomains

* `brutas-subdomains-1-small.txt` - a fairly reasonable list for host discovery composed of common conventions, self-hosted software etc.
* `brutas-subdomains-2-large.txt` - extended list with some extra pre-/postfixes like `host-srv`, `f.host` or `host10`

### Keywords

* `keywords/brutas-lang-int-common.txt` - set of most frequent English (and not only) words used in passwords internationally (also from literature, pop culture etc)
* `keywords/brutas-lang-int-less.txt` - less frequent English words used in passwords by native speakers
* `keywords/brutas-lang-*` - other languages based mostly on leaks
* `keywords/brutas-all-lang.txt` - all languages combined
* `keywords/brutas-subdomains.txt` - keywords and rules used to generate lists for subdomains
* `keywords/brutas-subdomains-extra.txt` - additional prefixes for subdomain discovery
* `keywords/brutas-wifi.txt` - bits and pieces useful in generating passwords for wireless networks
* `keywords/brutas-custom.txt` - file used with `main.Custom` generator

## Building

The build process is automated and handled by the script located in `./scripts/build.py`. Check it out to understand what are the blocks and how I set the priorities (or in other words what is most probable in my opinion).
